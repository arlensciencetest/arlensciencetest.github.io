MATTER
Matter is anything that takes up space and has mass. Matter is all around us and everything is made of matter.

Types of matter

Solid - Unchangeable shape and volume, the particles are very close together, vibrate, the particles have a pattern and aren’t able to move. 
Examples: Table, Box, Remote

Liquid - Unchangeable volume but shape can change, the particles have a random arrangement, the particles move around each other and the particles and are close together
Examples: Milk, Water


Gas - Volume and shape both change, the particles have a random arrangement, the particles move quickly in every direction and the particles are very far apart 

PARTICLE THEORY
A particle is a very small piece of matter. They make up matter like solid, liquid or gas.
A single particle of aluminium foil does not look the same as a piece of aluminum foil

TEAM HI
T - All particles are TINY
E - There are EMPTY spaces in between the particles
A - They are ATTRACTED to one another
M - They are MOVING all the time

H - The speed of movement changes depending on the HEAT levels
I - THe particles in a pure substance are IDENTICAL


MATTER IN MIXTURES
There are different ways to separate mixtures or solutions. These are called evaporation, sifting, filtration, distillation, magnetism, separation and flotation and settling


Evaporation - Turning liquid into gas/vapor, Example: Puddles disappearing over time
Sifting - Separating things using size, Example: Separating lumps of sugar
Filtration - Separating solids from liquids, Example: Using a strainer for pasta
Distillation - Boiling stuff to separate particles, Example: Boiling water to make clean water
Magnetism - Using a magnet to separate magnetic particles from other particles, Examples: using a magnet to separate pieces
Separation - Sorting different pieces by hand, Example: Sorting different types of toys
Flotation and Settling - Heavy things sink and light things float, Example: Leaves on pools


Classifying Substances

A substance is a type of matter that is made of the same properties
There are 2 types of substances, a pure substance and a mixture

Pure substance - types of matter that only has 1 particle
Examples: Sugar, Distilled water, Oxygen

Mixture - types of matter that have more than 1 kind of particle.
Examples: Normal pancakes, Ketchup, Pudding and Salad

Mixtures can be split into two parts, solutions/homogeneous and mechanical/heterogeneous mixtures. If you can see the different kinds of particles in a mixture, it's called a mechanical/heterogeneous mixture, but if you can't then it is a solution/homogeneous mixture.

1: Mechanical/Heterogeneous mixtures: Mixtures where you can see the different particles, Examples: Salads and Omelets

2: Solution/Homogeneous Mixtures: Mixtures where you cant see the different particles, Examples: Coffee, Tea and Soda


Separation

Separation using Distillation
If you heat a solution it will evaporate the solvent and the gas will condense and drip into another container

Separation using Evaporation
When a solution involving water gets heated, it can evaporate the water and leave behind whatever is left of the solution.

Separation using Sifting
Sifting is usually used to separate one solid from another. If you get a strainer or something else and set the holes to fit the size of one solid it can separate the solid from the other solid

Separation using Filtration
Filtration is used to separate solids from liquids/gases. Like sifting, you can use a strainer to separate liquids/gases from solids

Separation using Magnetism
If you use a magnet you can separate particles that are attracted to magnets from other particles

Separation using Separation/Sorting
Depending on the characteristics of  the substances, you can use your bare hands or some other tools to separate them.

Separation using Floatation and Settling
If materials have a different density, they can either float to the top or settle to the bottom.

Parts of a Solution
A solution is a substance that is made with two or more particles. THe particles in a solution are evenly spread out so they often look like a pure substance. There's two components in a solution, solutes and solvents.

Solutes - A solute is a substance that dissolves, found in smaller amounts like lemon juice in lemonade.

Solvent - A substance that the solute dissolves in, found in greater amounts, like water in lemonade

Insoluble - A substance that cannot dissolve into a solvent.

Soluble - A substance that can dissolve into a solvent


Extra stuff
Universal solvent - Water, It can mix with so many things and it comes in contact with so many things as it travels in the water cycle, It covers 70% of the earth’s surface

Is apple juice a mixture or a pure substance? It is not a pure substance. It is a mixture of Sugar particles, Water particles, Flavour particles, Vitamin particles

Is tap water a mixture or a pure substance? It is not a pure substance. Tap water may contain: Aluminium, Salt, Iron, Fluorine, Calcium, Magnesium, Chlorine

Chemistry is the study of the properties of matter and how they change

Properties of matter
Matter can have different characteristics/properties
Qualitative description - refers of how it looks/feels (think of the 5 senses)
Quantitative properties - refers to the measurements/specific amounts.
